# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Prompt Versioning System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the versioning system for prompt repositories.
# Details:
Create a mechanism to track changes to prompts by saving each edit as a new version in the PromptVersion table. Include timestamp, editor, and changes in each version record.

# Test Strategy:
Test version creation on prompt edits. Verify that version history is accurately maintained and displayed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Version Data Model Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the underlying data structures and storage mechanisms to represent and persist versioned entities, including fields for version numbers, timestamps, and change data.
### Details:
Define the schema for storing versions, ensuring support for metadata and efficient retrieval of version history.

## 2. Version Creation on Edit [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement logic to automatically create a new version entry whenever an entity is edited, capturing the state before and after the change.
### Details:
Ensure that each edit triggers version creation, incrementing version numbers according to the chosen scheme (e.g., semantic versioning).

## 3. Version History UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Develop a user interface component that displays the list of all versions for a given entity, including relevant metadata and navigation controls.
### Details:
Provide clear visualization of version history, allowing users to browse and select specific versions.

## 4. Version Comparison Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement functionality to compare two selected versions, highlighting differences in content and metadata.
### Details:
Enable users to select any two versions from the history and view a detailed comparison of their changes.

## 5. Version Metadata Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Ensure that each version captures and stores relevant metadata such as author, timestamp, change summary, and reason for change.
### Details:
Extend the data model and UI to display and manage version metadata for auditing and traceability.

## 6. Version Rollback Capability [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Implement the ability to restore an entity to a previous version, updating the current state and creating a new version entry to record the rollback.
### Details:
Allow users to select a version from the history and revert the entity to that state, ensuring data integrity and proper version tracking.
