# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Forking Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable users to fork existing prompt repositories.
# Details:
Develop functionality to duplicate a prompt repository and its latest version, linking it to the original repository via forkedFromRepoId.

# Test Strategy:
Test the forking process to ensure the new repository is correctly linked and contains the latest version of the original prompt.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fork UI Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the user interface elements that allow users to initiate the forking process, such as a 'Fork' button and related dialogs or prompts.
### Details:
This includes placement of the fork button, confirmation dialogs, and any user guidance or tooltips needed to explain the forking process.

## 2. Repository Duplication Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the backend logic to duplicate the repository's data, including files, branches, and metadata, ensuring a new repository is created for the user.
### Details:
This involves copying all repository content and settings to a new repository instance under the user's account, maintaining data integrity.

## 3. Version Copying Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement the mechanism to copy all commit history, branches, and tags from the original repository to the forked repository.
### Details:
Ensure that the full version history is preserved so that the forked repository is an exact replica in terms of commit lineage and structure.

## 4. Original Repository Linking [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Establish and store a reference from the forked repository back to the original repository to maintain the parent-child relationship.
### Details:
This enables features like pull requests to the upstream repository and visualizes the relationship between the fork and its source.

## 5. Fork History/Relationship Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Create visualizations or UI components that display the relationship between the original and forked repositories, including fork lineage and history.
### Details:
This may include graphs, lists, or other visual elements that help users understand the ancestry and network of forks.
