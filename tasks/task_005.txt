# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Prompt Repository Creation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Allow logged-in users to create new prompt repositories.
# Details:
Develop a UI for creating new prompt repositories. Implement backend logic to save new repositories to the database with initial metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Test repository creation process, ensuring data is saved correctly and visible in the public browsing interface.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Repository Creation Form UI with Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user interface for creating repositories, including input fields for required metadata and client-side validation to ensure data integrity before submission.
### Details:
The form should include fields such as repository name, description, and any other required metadata. Implement validation rules (e.g., required fields, character limits) and provide user feedback for invalid input.

## 2. Develop Backend API Endpoint for Saving Repositories [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint that receives repository creation requests, validates the data server-side, and persists the repository information to the database.
### Details:
The API should accept validated data from the UI, perform additional server-side validation as needed, and handle database operations for creating new repository records.

## 3. Implement Initial Metadata Handling for Repositories [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Define and manage the initial set of metadata fields required for each repository, ensuring consistent structure and storage in the database.
### Details:
Determine which metadata fields are mandatory and optional, enforce their presence during creation, and ensure they are correctly stored and retrievable from the database.

## 4. Integrate User Authentication to Associate Repositories with Creators [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Ensure that repository creation is restricted to authenticated users and that each repository is associated with its creator in the database.
### Details:
Update the backend logic to require authentication for repository creation requests, and store the user ID or relevant identifier alongside the repository record for future reference and access control.
