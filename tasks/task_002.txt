# Title: Implement User Authentication with Clerk
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up user authentication using Clerk to manage user sessions.
# Details:
Integrate Clerk into the Next.js application. Configure Clerk to handle user registration, login, and session management. Ensure that only logged-in users can create, fork, or edit prompts.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and session persistence. Ensure unauthorized actions are blocked for non-logged-in users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initial Clerk Setup and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Clerk, create a Clerk application, and configure Clerk in the project. This includes setting up Clerk's provider and environment variables.
### Details:
Follow the official Clerk documentation to install the Clerk package, register your application on the Clerk dashboard, and add the necessary configuration (such as API keys) to your project. Integrate the Clerk provider at the root of your application to enable authentication features.

## 2. User Registration Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the user registration (sign-up) flow using Clerk's pre-built or custom components.
### Details:
Add the <SignUp /> component to your application, typically on a dedicated registration page. Ensure that users can create new accounts and that registration data is handled securely.

## 3. Login Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement user login using Clerk's <SignIn /> component, allowing users to authenticate with their credentials.
### Details:
Add the <SignIn /> component to a login page. Configure the component to handle various authentication methods supported by Clerk, such as email/password or social logins.

## 4. Session Management [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Manage user sessions, including handling sign-in, sign-out, and session persistence across the application.
### Details:
Utilize Clerk's session management features to track authentication state. Use control components like <SignedIn />, <SignedOut />, and <UserButton /> to display user-specific content and provide sign-out functionality.

## 5. Authorization Middleware for Protected Routes [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Implement middleware or control components to restrict access to protected routes based on user authentication and authorization status.
### Details:
Use Clerk's <Protect /> or similar control components to guard routes and ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages. Optionally, implement role-based access control if required.
