# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add Tagging and Metadata System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a system to tag prompts with model compatibility and domain metadata.
# Details:
Develop a tagging system that allows users to add tags to prompts. Implement search and filter functionality based on these tags.

# Test Strategy:
Test the tagging system by adding, searching, and filtering prompts based on tags. Ensure tags are stored and retrieved correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Tag Data Model Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the underlying data model for tags, ensuring support for many-to-many relationships between tags and repositories, and allowing for flexible metadata storage.
### Details:
Define database schemas or ORM models for tags, repositories, and their associations. Ensure the model supports efficient querying and scalability.

## 2. Tag Creation and Editing UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop the user interface components for creating, editing, and deleting tags, including validation and normalization to prevent duplicates.
### Details:
Implement forms and controls for tag management, integrate with the backend, and provide real-time feedback to users.

## 3. Tag Association with Repositories [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Enable users to associate and disassociate tags with repositories through the UI and backend, updating the data model accordingly.
### Details:
Implement UI elements for tagging repositories, handle backend logic for updating associations, and ensure data integrity.

## 4. Tag-Based Search Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3
### Description: Implement efficient search algorithms and UI components to allow users to search repositories by tags, supporting partial matches and multiple tag queries.
### Details:
Optimize database queries or use search indexes to ensure fast retrieval, and design intuitive search interfaces.

## 5. Tag Filtering and Categorization [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.4
### Description: Develop features for filtering repositories by tags and categorizing tags (e.g., by type or popularity) to enhance discoverability and user experience.
### Details:
Implement UI filters, backend logic for tag categorization, and display tag statistics or groupings as needed.
