# Prompt Hub: The GitHub for AI Prompts

Prompt Hub is an open, community-first platform designed to revolutionize the way AI/LLM prompts are shared, forked, and remixed. By centralizing high-quality prompts in dedicated repositories, Prompt Hub empowers AI enthusiasts, prompt engineers, content creators, and enterprises to collaborate and iterate on proven prompt strategies—reducing the friction of scattered, unorganized resources.

## Overview

Prompt Hub addresses the challenges of discovering and managing effective prompts by offering:
- **Centralized Storage:** Each prompt is maintained in its own repository complete with a detailed description, usage notes, and an edit history.
- **Collaboration & Versioning:** Users can fork, edit, and evolve prompts seamlessly, with every change recorded as a new version.
- **User-Friendly Access:** The platform is open to everyone for browsing, while authenticated users gain the ability to create and modify prompts.
- **Community Engagement:** With built-in features like starring, copying, and downloading prompts, community feedback continuously drives quality improvements.

## Core Features

1. **Prompt Repositories**
   - **What:** Every repository holds a single prompt along with its metadata including description, usage guidelines, and version history.
   - **Why:** This simple “one prompt = one repository” model streamlines discovery and collaboration.
   - **How:** Users are able to browse, fork, and edit prompts using a clean, intuitive web interface.

2. **Versioning & Forking**
   - **What:** A robust version control system captures every edit with details such as timestamps, editor information, and change summaries.
   - **Why:** It encourages transparent collaboration and safe experimentation.
   - **How:** New versions are created on each edit, and forking replicates the latest version into a new, independently modifiable repository.

3. **Tags & Metadata**
   - **What:** Prompts are tagged based on model compatibility (e.g., GPT-4, Llama) and domains (e.g., productivity, marketing).
   - **Why:** Tags help users quickly filter and find the most relevant prompts.
   - **How:** A simple tagging system integrated with search and filtering mechanisms.

4. **Copy/Download Functionality**
   - **What:** Users can easily copy prompt texts to the clipboard or download them as .txt files.
   - **Why:** This reduces friction for users who want to apply prompts immediately in their AI workflows.
   - **How:** A dedicated UI button provides one-click copy/download capabilities.

5. **Community Engagement**
   - **What:** Features such as public browsing, star/like functionality, and basic feedback options encourage interaction.
   - **Why:** Lower barriers to contribution help build a vibrant, collaborative community.
   - **How:** Even without signing in, users can explore and search through the public repository of prompts.

## Technical Architecture

Prompt Hub is built with modern, scalable technologies:
- **Frontend:** Developed using Next.js/React, it provides a responsive and accessible interface for browsing and managing prompts.
- **Backend:** Powered by Supabase (Postgres) which handles data storage for prompt repositories, version histories, and user data.
- **Authentication:** Managed with Clerk, ensuring secure and efficient user session handling.
- **Version Control:** Instead of a full Git system, prompt versions are recorded in a lightweight database model that logs every change.
- **APIs & Integrations:** Supabase auto-generated REST/GraphQL endpoints handle CRUD operations, with scope for future external integrations.

## Development Insights & Roadmap

Insights from our completed development tasks have shaped the evolution of Prompt Hub:
- **Repository Setup & Initialization:** Early tasks successfully established the project repository, incorporating a modern Next.js starter with Clerk and Supabase integrations.
- **User Authentication:** Completed user authentication tasks with Clerk have provided a secure and smooth sign-up/sign-in experience.
- **Database & Schema Designs:** The database structure for user data, prompt repositories, and prompt versions was implemented based on detailed schema design tasks.
- **Public Browsing & Search:** Tasks focused on developing the public browsing interface, including list views, detailed repository displays, and advanced filtering mechanisms (tag- and keyword-based).
- **Prompt Creation & Versioning:** The prompt repository creation workflow has been refined by tasks that ensured a seamless connection between the UI, backend API, and version tracking system.
- **Metrics:** With approximately 60% of parent tasks and 60% of subtasks completed, the development roadmap is on track, highlighting successful implementations in authentication, database connectivity, and UI features.

### Upcoming Enhancements
- **Advanced Prompt Collections:** Grouping prompts into curated collections for easier discovery.
- **Enhanced Moderation Tools:** Further refining community quality control through improved moderation capabilities.
- **AI Integration Improvements:** Facilitating integrations with popular AI tools to enable one-click prompt import and testing.
- **Refined Version Control Options:** Introducing more nuanced version comparisons and rollback features as the platform matures.
