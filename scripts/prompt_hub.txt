# Overview  
Prompt Hub is an open, community-first platform to share, fork, and remix AI/LLM prompts—a "GitHub for prompts." It solves the pain point of scattered, unorganized high-quality prompts by providing a central repository where anyone can find, edit, and reuse prompts. This benefits AI enthusiasts, prompt engineers, content creators, and enterprises who want to collaborate on or quickly adopt verified prompts.

# Core Features  
1. **Public Prompt Repositories**  
   - What: Each repository holds one prompt (text) along with descriptions, usage notes, version history, and forks.  
   - Why: Simplifies how we share, discover, and evolve prompts without a complex code structure.  
   - How: One prompt = one repo. Users can browse all public repos freely. Logged-in users can create/fork/modify their own or existing prompts.  

2. **Versioning & Forking**  
   - What: Each prompt repository maintains a linear edit history, plus the ability to fork a prompt.  
   - Why: Encourages community collaboration and ensures prompt evolution is tracked (similar to version control, but simplified).  
   - How: On each edit, a new version entry is saved (timestamp, editor, changes). Forking replicates the latest version to a new repo, marking its “forked from” lineage.  

3. **Tags & Metadata**  
   - What: Ability to tag prompts by model compatibility (e.g., GPT-4, Llama) or domain (e.g., productivity, marketing).  
   - Why: Helps users filter relevant prompts quickly and handle model-specific differences.  
   - How: Simple tagging system stored in the database; search and filter UI built on these tags.  

4. **Open Browsing & Community Engagement**  
   - What: Anyone (even without logging in) can view and search all prompts to encourage exploration and adoption.  
   - Why: Low barriers increase community engagement and potential contributions.  
   - How: Public browsing with search, star/like, or basic feedback. Optional login for editing features.  

5. **Copy/Download Functionality**  
   - What: Users can easily copy prompt text or download it as .txt for immediate use in their AI tool of choice.  
   - Why: Quick adoption—no friction in transferring prompts elsewhere.  
   - How: Simple UI button that copies text to clipboard or offers a downloadable file.

# Technical Architecture  
1. **System Components**  
   - Frontend: Built with a modern framework (e.g., Next.js/React) for browsing, forking, editing prompts.  
   - Backend:  
     - Supabase for data storage (Postgres)  
     - Clerk for auth (manages user sessions)  
   - Versioning:  
     - Internal DB-based approach (not raw Git).  
     - Each prompt repo has an ID; each edit creates a new version record in "PromptVersions."  
   - APIs/Integrations:  
     - Supabase auto-generated REST or GraphQL endpoints for basic CRUD.  
     - Future expansions for external integrations (plugins, etc.) once MVP is stable.  

2. **Data Models**  
   - User: (id, email, username, etc.)  
   - PromptRepo: (id, title, authorId, tags, createdAt, updatedAt, forkedFromRepoId)  
   - PromptVersion: (id, repoId, promptText, description, editorId, createdAt)  

3. **Infrastructure Requirements**  
   - Hosted on a serverless or PaaS solution (e.g., Vercel/Netlify + Supabase).  
   - Minimal overhead for early MVP; can scale with user demand.  

# Development Roadmap  
1. **MVP Requirements**  
   - Public, open browsing of prompt repositories.  
   - Simple user registration (Clerk) for creating/forking/editing repos.  
   - Basic UI for prompt submission, versioning, and forking.  
   - Tagging system for model/domain metadata.  
   - Copy/download prompts.  
   - Basic moderation (e.g., admin-level deletion of spam/inappropriate content).  

2. **Future Enhancements**  
   - Integration with AI tools (one-click import).  
   - Collections or “notebooks” to group related prompts.  
   - Private/organization repositories (enterprise features).  
   - Advanced discussion, comments, or rating systems.  
   - More robust version-control (semi-git-like merges).  
   - Automated prompt testing, previewing results from multiple models.  

3. **Scope and Detailing**  
   - Each MVP feature should be atomic and testable:  
     - Registration system,  
     - Public browsing,  
     - Repo creation, submission, forking,  
     - Version tracking,  
     - Tagging/metadata.  
   - Verify everything works end-to-end before layering additional functionality (like advanced integrations or private repos).  

# Logical Dependency Chain  
1. **Foundation**  
   - Set up Supabase, Clerk, and a basic Next.js/React frontend.  
   - Data models for users, prompt repos, prompt versions.  
2. **User Authentication & Public Browsing**  
   - Allow anonymous users to browse, but require login to edit or create.  
   - Add basic search/filter for prompts by tags or keywords.  
3. **Repo Creation & Versioning**  
   - Implement base CRUD for prompts.  
   - Implement the mechanism to track versions (PromptVersions table).  
4. **Forking**  
   - Implement the ability to duplicate a prompt repo (with its latest version) and link “forkedFromRepoId.”  
5. **Enhance UI/UX**  
   - Add copy/download features.  
   - Provide a simple “star” or “like” system to prioritize refined prompts.  
6. **Moderation & Admin Tools**  
   - Basic control panel to remove spam or block users if necessary.  
7. **Iterate**  
   - Gather feedback, refine, test, prepare for next features (collections, advanced versioning, etc.).  

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical Complexity (Versioning)**  
  - Risk: Implementing a full Git system is too complex for MVP.  
  - Mitigation: Use a simpler DB approach to store each "version" as a record—no merges or branching needed initially.  
- **Overscoping & Feature Creep**  
  - Risk: Trying to implement everything (testing environment, advanced merges) from the start.  
  - Mitigation: Stick to the core MVP, gather community feedback, and iterate.  
- **Low Community Engagement**  
  - Risk: No traction if content isn’t seeded.  
  - Mitigation: Seed high-quality prompts, encourage initial user base with curated examples.  
- **Quality Control**  
  - Risk: Spam or low-value prompts cluttering the site.  
  - Mitigation: Basic moderation tools and reported-content flows until advanced solutions can be built.  

# Appendix  
- **Research Findings**:  
  - Existing solutions (FlowGPT, PromptBase) focus on either curated flows or paid prompts; we differentiate by being free, open, repo-based.  
  - PromptHub-like platforms exist but often are enterprise-centric.  
- **Technical Specs**:  
  - Next.js + Supabase + Clerk for MVP is tested and straightforward.  
  - Consider minimal discrete microservices—front/back can remain single app for simplicity.  
  - Deploy on Vercel for quick iteration and immediate user testing.
