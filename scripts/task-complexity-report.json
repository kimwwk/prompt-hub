      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup into specific steps including: 1) Creating the GitHub repository, 2) Initializing Next.js with the appropriate configuration, 3) Setting up Supabase connection, and 4) Integrating Clerk authentication basics",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Next.js, Supabase, Clerk) but follows standard setup procedures. The complexity is moderate as it requires coordinating different technologies but doesn't involve complex logic or algorithms."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Clerk authentication implementation into: 1) Initial Clerk setup and configuration, 2) User registration flow, 3) Login functionality, 4) Session management, and 5) Authorization middleware for protected routes",
      "reasoning": "Authentication involves security considerations and integration with third-party services. The complexity is higher due to the need to handle various authentication states, user sessions, and proper authorization checks across the application."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase setup into: 1) Project initialization and connection configuration, 2) User table schema design, 3) PromptRepo table schema design, and 4) PromptVersion table schema design with appropriate relationships",
      "reasoning": "Database setup requires careful planning of schema design and relationships between tables. The complexity comes from ensuring proper data modeling that will support all the application features while maintaining data integrity."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Public Browsing Feature",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the public browsing feature into: 1) Basic list view UI, 2) Detailed repository view, 3) Search functionality implementation, 4) Tag-based filtering, 5) Keyword-based filtering, and 6) Pagination/infinite scrolling",
      "reasoning": "This feature involves both frontend and backend work with search and filtering capabilities. The complexity is higher due to the need to implement efficient search algorithms, handle various filter combinations, and ensure good performance with potentially large datasets."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down repository creation into: 1) Creation form UI with validation, 2) Backend API endpoint for saving repositories, 3) Initial metadata handling, and 4) Integration with user authentication to associate repositories with creators",
      "reasoning": "This task requires form handling, validation, and database operations. The complexity is moderate as it involves standard CRUD operations but needs to handle user input validation and proper data relationships."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the versioning system into: 1) Version data model implementation, 2) Version creation on edit, 3) Version history UI, 4) Version comparison functionality, 5) Version metadata tracking, and 6) Version rollback capability",
      "reasoning": "Versioning systems are inherently complex as they need to track changes over time, handle conflicts, and maintain data integrity. This requires careful design of data structures and algorithms to efficiently store and retrieve version history."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Forking Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down forking functionality into: 1) Fork UI implementation, 2) Repository duplication logic, 3) Version copying mechanism, 4) Original repository linking, and 5) Fork history/relationship visualization",
      "reasoning": "Forking involves duplicating data while maintaining relationships between original and forked repositories. The complexity comes from ensuring proper data duplication, maintaining referential integrity, and handling potential conflicts."

      "taskTitle": "Add Tagging and Metadata System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the tagging system into: 1) Tag data model implementation, 2) Tag creation/editing UI, 3) Tag association with repositories, 4) Tag-based search functionality, and 5) Tag filtering and categorization",
      "reasoning": "Tagging systems require many-to-many relationships and efficient search algorithms. The complexity involves designing a flexible tagging system that can handle various metadata types while maintaining good search performance."

      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down copy/download functionality into: 1) Clipboard copy implementation with browser compatibility, 2) Text file generation and download, and 3) User feedback and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This feature is relatively straightforward but requires handling browser-specific APIs for clipboard access and file downloads. The complexity is lower as it involves standard web APIs with some cross-browser compatibility considerations."
